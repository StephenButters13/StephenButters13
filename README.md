# About Me
Hello! My name is Stephen Butters. I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina where I first got interested in the world of Computer Science through my high school's robotics team. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions. My academic journey has been marked by a consistent commitment to excellence, as evidenced by my presence on the Dean’s and Chancellor’s Lists.

## Academic Background
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte in May 2025, with a minor in Japanese and a concentration in Data Science. My studies focused on areas such as full-stack development, machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, and I gained hands-on experience through coursework and applied projects.

## Projects
### Mock E-Commerce Website, Software Engineering
I collaborated with an agile team to design and build a high-fidelity mock bookstore website using Python, HTML, and SQL. My contributions spanned both front-end and back-end development, leading to the creation of a functional online platform with intuitive navigation and a responsive design.

### Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent Implementation, Intro to Artificial Intelligence
In this project, I developed AI agents capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe against human opponents using MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms. I enhanced the efficiency of the AI’s decision-making process by implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning, which significantly optimized the algorithm’s performance. Additionally, I incorporated a feature that allows users to select between the MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms during gameplay, providing a more interactive and engaging experience.

## Data Science Website
This is my personal website where I showcase my data science projects, analyzing datasets, building predictive models, and presenting insights through visualizations.
